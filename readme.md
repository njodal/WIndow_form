A simple, declarative oriented framework to create Window Forms in Python.

While it can be used for all kinds of forms, it was created with the purpose of being applied in Robotics, where the need to visualize complex algorithms and, above all, observe the effect of parameter changes is very common.

The forms are defined in a declarative way in an YAML (layouts, controls, toolbar, menus, etc.) and used in a Python program with just a few lines of code.
Run `python view_example.py` to see the provided functionality.
